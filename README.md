> **EduTrust** is a tool-augmented AI assistant designed to provide personalized educational support. Operating as a ReAct-style reasoning agent, it intelligently routes queries to specialist sub-agents (Math, Physics, Literature, etc.) to deliver accurate, step-by-step guidance.

### Key Features
-   **Smart Routing**: Distinguishes between simple queries and complex problems requiring multi-step reasoning.
-   **Specialist Agents**: Dedicated experts for Math, Science, Humanities, and General Knowledge.
-   **Real-time Search**: Integrated web search for current events and fact-checking.

```

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Python 3.11+**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2.  **Node.js & npm**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
3.  **uv** (An extremely fast Python package installer and resolver):
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```

## Backend Setup

The backend is located in the `backend/` directory.

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Use `uv` to sync dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

3.  **Run the Server:**
    Start the development server with hot-reload enabled.
    ```bash
    uv run uvicorn src.main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Frontend Setup

The frontend is located in the `frontend/` directory.

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  **Build for Production:**
    To build the app for deployment:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Development Workflow

-   **Backend**: The `uv run` command automatically handles the virtual environment for you.
-   **Frontend**: Vite provides a fast development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

## Deployment (Terraform + GitHub Actions)

This repo supports automated provisioning + deployment of the backend to AWS EC2 using Terraform, and optional proxy deployment to Cloudflare Workers.

-   Terraform infrastructure lives in `.github/terraform/` (EC2 + Security Group + remote state on S3).
-   CI/CD is implemented via GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/`.

See `/docs/deployment.md` for the end-to-end architecture, required GitHub secrets, and the deploy flow.
